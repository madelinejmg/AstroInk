# AstroInk
A faster way to search for astrophysical research papers from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/).


# What is AstroInk?
AstroInk is a Python-based tool designed to streamline the process of finding, summarizing, and citing astrophysical research papers from arXiv, an open-access repository featuring the latest research papers. Users will be able to input a topic or keyword (such as "transits" or "stellar variability"), and the tool will automatically query the arXiv API to retrieve the most relevant papers. It will then parses each paper's metadata, including the title, authors, abstract, publication source, and date. Using a natural language processing (NLP) model, AstroInk will summarize abstracts into concise and accessible language. It will also be capable of auto-generating citations in formats like BibTeX or APA, ready to drop into research documents.

AstroInk will be useful for students and early-career researchers who are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of new papers being published daily. Instead of skimming through dozens of abstracts or manually formatting citations, users will be able to quickly gain insights into current research topics trends and compile bibliographies in seconds. Its modular design will allow for flexible use: from the command lines, Jupyter Notebooks, or via a graphical interface. By combining the latest astrophysical literature search with summarization and citation support, AstroInk will help bridge the gap between information overload and efficient scientific discovery.
